# marPy
A Python library to interact with DC's MAR (master address repository) API

## DC’s Master Address Repository

District of Columbia’s [Master Address Repository
(MAR)](https://dcatlas.dcgis.dc.gov/mar/) provides a [web
service](https://opendata.dc.gov/pages/mar-webservices) with geocoding
and address verification operations. The `marPy` package gives Python users
a set of fuctions to interact with the MAR web service. The MAR web
service is free to use and requies no credentialing.

## What’s Inside?

Currently only the following function is implemented:

  - `find_location()`: Location query for DC addresses, intersections,
    blocks, and place names

## Installation

You can install the development version from GitHub

``` r
$ git clone https://github.com/tombuko/marPy.git
```

## Usage

Below is an example of the output provided by the MAR (in long
format):

``` r
 
```
